The script dem.pl will identify the sequening run to be processed, edit samplesheet 
to create new samplesheets which will then be used to demultiplex the run. The jobs would automatically be fired onto cluster.
The script is located on athens at `/ifs/data/Hiseq/Runs/` ; execute `perl dem.pl`  to start demultiplexing.
